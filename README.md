# Password-Manager-Android-Application
This application is the most complex project that Iâ€™ve made. It is fully developed by me, and I was even planning to launch it on Google Play. Being built in Java, it runs only on android devices.

Security is one of the most important things in our days. Having a very strong password for every account is a must-have, if you want toprotect your data against attacks. This app was designed to solve one of the most common problem when it comes about passwords : FORGETTING. By storing your passwords and accessing them with a simple click, you can really forget about them. For keeping security level as high as possible, app doesn't communicate with an online database (which can be vulnerable) and it uses complex encryption algorithms. Besides that, being built in Java, the app is low memory consumption, using multithreading or concepts that speed up the processes of the app.
